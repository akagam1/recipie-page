            <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 1/2 pounds 80% lean 20% fat ground beef or ground chuck</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons seasoning salt</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                    <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p><h3>Recipie</h3></p>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the grill to 375 degrees F (medium-high)</li>
                    <li>In a large bowl, add the beef. Sprinkle evenly with the Worcestershire sauce, seasoning salt, garlic powder, and pepper. Use your hands to mix the ingredients until they are just combined.</li>
                    <li>Divide the meat mixture into fourths. Take 1/4 of the meat mixture and use your hands to press it into the shape of a hamburger patty that is about 3/4 inch thick. Make an indention in the middle of the patty to prevent bulging in the center of the hamburger as it cooks. Repeat with the remaining meat mixture, making 4 hamburgers.</li>
                    <li>Place the burgers on the grill. Cook 4-5 minutes on the first side. Flip the burgers over and cook an additional 4-5 minutes, until the burgers have reached the desired doneness.*</li>
                    <li>If adding cheese, lay a slice of cheese on each burger patty about 1 minute before taking the burgers off the grill, so the cheese has a chance to melt.</li>
                    <li>Serve the burgers on hamburger buns with optional hamburger toppings.</li>
                </ol>
